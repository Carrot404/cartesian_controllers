# Cartesian Controller Handles
This package provides graphical click-and-drop handles (interactive markers) for
RViz to be used in conjunction with the Cartesian Controllers.

The markers can be used to control the robot end-effector online, which is
especially handy for testing scenarios and Cartesian trajectory teaching.
